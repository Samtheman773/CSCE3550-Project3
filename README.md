# Project 3 Bulking up our JWKS server.


Objective

To further enhance the security and functionality of your JWKS server by implementing AES encryption for private keys, adding user registration capabilities, logging authentication requests, and optionally introducing a rate limiter to control request frequency.
Background

As cybersecurity threats evolve, it's crucial to continuously improve the security and robustness of authentication systems. This project focuses on adding layers of security to the JWKS server by encrypting sensitive data, managing user registrations, and monitoring authentication requests. Additionally, implementing the optional rate limiter can prevent abuse and protect the server from potential DoS attacks.
